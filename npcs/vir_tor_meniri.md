# Interaction with Party
Zulban brought the [Incomplete mace](/items/incomplete_mace#consultation-with-vir) to Vir who informed him that it resembled a weapon of the [Knights of the Winged Sun](/factions/knights_of_the_winged_sun), and that Zulban should bring it to them at their barracks in the temple district. Vir said that these weapons usually had a metal haft with celestial inscriptions and an amethyst pommel. The party then gave the amethyst necklace that was found along side the head to Zulban. 

Zulban commissioned plate armour from Vir the week before the festival.

Grug purchased a maul from Vir.
