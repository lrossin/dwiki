# Description
Justin is the game warden of the Calvinus manor and cousin(?) to the head of the manor Rogerius Calvinus.

# Rumours
There are currently no known rumors about Justin, he seems like an upstanding guy.

# Interaction with Party
Grug met Justin when attempting to find a place to hunt and plant the [Bough of the Wandering Oak](/items/Bough_of_the_Wandering_Oak). He was willing to host another outdoorsman in the game forrest with a few stipulations and a price of 10gp. Justin has an understanding with the wolves of the forrest and asked that Grug not harm them and that she limit her catches to two bucks and one doe.
