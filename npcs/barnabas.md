# Description
Barnabus is a middle-aged halfling merchant that the party met on their way to [Cyfaraun](/locations/cyfaraun). He is a member of the [Blood & Sand](/factions/blood_and_sand), and can be found at the [Silk Pony](/locations/cyfaraun/gamblers_quarter#inns-and-taverns).

# History with the party
## Rescued from being eaten by trolls
On the journey to Cyfaraun, the part came across an overturned cart on a bridge being ransacked by goblins and trollkin. The party chose to attack and the fight led to a cave under the bridge. Inside, they found an unconscious Barnabas chained and beaten. When he awoke, frightened by Grug, Barnabas cast color spray at her. Grug tried to explain that she was not here to hurt him and killed all the scary trolls. Grug left to look for the keys to his chains, but left Burr to ensure he didn’t run off. Hearing the commotion Ganymede and Praahi joined them, and Ganymede gave the halfling the glasses he had found earlier. He had arrived with 8 amphora of honey, some mead, 3 companions and 4 ponies. Only 7 amphora remain. He had only survived by deceiving the trolls. The party agreed to load them back on the wagon and traveled to the city with him. Luckily the party failed to open his chest, as it was magically sealed and would have blown up.

## Travel to the City
The party travel towards the city and Barnabus told all about the city and what to expect to find there:
- Tournaments, Fort Jobs, Mercenary work, etc.
- Praahi told him about her devotion to lady Ianna, Barnabus recommends she meet [Valana](/npcs/valana) at the [Temple of Blade And Vail](/locations/cyfaraun#temples)
- The [mercenary's guild](/factions/mercenary_guild) can be found in an Eleven Temple (they kinda ripped off Ianna’s whole thing.
- If you’re interested in mercenary work, [Balcadur](/npcs/balcadur) is the one to talk to
- If you’re interested in guilds, the [Tower of Knowledge](/locations/cyfaraun/tower_of_knowledge) is your destination
- Barnubus is especially excited about the festivals.
- [The Emporium Square](/locations/cyfaraun/emporium_square)[^1] is filled with shops, battles, and tournaments
- If interested in the [Gladiatorial Arena](/locations/cyfaraun#gladitorial-arena), you should talk to [Maximus the Silversword](/npcs/maximus). He likes to train more exotic warriors
- As for forts, [Torres Tems](/locations/torres_tems) is desperate for help with brigand activity. Offering 1,000 for the Bandit Captain located in the [South Wildlands](/locations/south_wildlands)

[^1]: [The Player Journal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CbXlAgF5iTDefV3e5CwdvAl50astrfGmH_r4RO9s3W4) originally said Amphitheater instead of Emporium Square.

The party stayed at a tavern on the road for that night, and Barnabas offered to give them a ride on a river barge that was waiting for him the next day. The party accepted. They met with Barnabas's business associates at a hamlet on the [Miren River]. They were 4 human men, 1 human woman, and a hill dwarf. They were alarmed by the party, particularly by Grug. Barnabas negotiated the party's passage with them. He had assumed they would just let the party come along. Eventually he assured the party that they were welcomed. He seemed a bit flustered after his negotiations. The others seem inconvenienced but not upset.

They told the party that they travel this route frequently, and work for the same employer as Barnabas, [Selene](/npcs/selene). It seemed that entering the city by boat was a strategy to avoid paying taxes.

Once inside the city, and at the docks, Barnabas recommended some taverns to the party.
- [The Half-Full Tankard](/locations/cyfaraun#inns-and-taverns) in the Gambler's Quarter
- [The Cask & Crow](/locations/cyfaraun#inns-and-taverns), a midscale establishment
- [The Wizards Blade](/locations/cyfaraun#inns-and-taverns), an upscale establishment. He mentioned he knows the owner, an elf named Lasri
Barnabas bids his farewells to the party, and invites them to stop by the Silk Pony a few nights later, where he would introduce them to his boss. He thought she would be grateful for their service. 

## Meeting at the Silk Pony
The party arrived during the off hours, but saw Barnabas playing cards. Praahi noticed that folks were clocking the arrival and noticed someone headed into a side room. Barnabas seemed terrified that the party showed up and was worried for them. He said that the hall was not the best place to talk, and that the boss wasn't in, but the party should talk with [Thanna](/npcs/thanna). In the side room, Thanna explains that the Silk Pony is the Blood & Sand Headquarters. After the retaliation to the mugging a few days prior, the party is not welcome here. She offered the party an escape through the sewers as a thank you for saving Barnabas, but to expect to be hunted by the gang.
