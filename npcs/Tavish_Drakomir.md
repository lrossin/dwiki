# Description



# Rumours
>  Left his order to follow Zeadora about 2 weeks ago, but no one has heard from him since. 
> - Centurian Celi, Temple of the Winged Sun

>  Tavish would never hurt Zeadora, but can't say the same of his family (the Drakomirs)
> - Solfina Geldius, Blade Sister of Ianna

> Secret relationship between Tavish and Zeadora, but no one will speak on it. When anything is mentioned about the two makes those close to them visibly uncomfortable.
> - Body language of Solfina and Tavish

> Tavish feels guilty for not believing Zeadora when she spoke of her visions. How could they be true if the Winged Sun was unaware. He also feels guilty for abandoning his oath to the empire.
> - Tavish Drakomir, Bandit Camp

# Interaction with Party
## Temple of Winged Sun
Have only heard of his recent disappearance in persuit of [Zeadora](/npcs/zeadora_ambador). The Knights of the Winged Sun have asked for assistance finding him.
## Bandit Camp
Tavish was found in the cage of prisioners at the bandit camp. He wants to continue his search, but is too weak. We heal him and ask him to help the prisioners get to Cyfaraun safely as they are not fighters. He agrees as long as we continue the search for Zeadora. We give him rations, his shield, and advice on his route back to the city.
