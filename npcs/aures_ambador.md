# Description
Head of the [Tower of Knowledge](/locations/cyfaraun/tower_district/tower_of_knowledge)
*image goes here*

# Rumours
> He was sent away to the 'Chapter House.' Since the capital city’s tower is the only ‘true’ tower of knowledge he must’ve done something to be sent away.
>
> He cannot be trusted, he is hiring and sending people to their deaths in the wasteland. 
> - Nefric and Loris Olmine at the Countryside Inn
