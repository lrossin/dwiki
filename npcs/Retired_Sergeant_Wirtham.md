# Interaction with Party
Wirtham first interacted with [grug](/player_characters/grug) when she was looking for sparring partners during some down time. They had a low stakes wrestling match that lost Wirtham 10gp. Impressed by their match, Wirtham returned later that day with some mercenary friends looking for another friendly fight with grug but with higher stakes fight. Grug agreed to fight Wirtham's friend [Ivar] and ultimately won a close fight with a large crowd looking on.
