# Description
A 47-year old Krysean with curly brown hair and swarthy skin. Balcadar has a barrel chest and thick biceps but has begun to grow soft around the middle. In informal situations most just call him "Bal". Bal is the guildmaster of the mercenaries guild and is well respected by it's members.

# Rumours

# Interaction with Party
Balcadar initially sized up the party when they joined the mercenary guild, worrying about [Kalland's](/player_characters/kalland) poor strength but overlooking it because of Bunteloaf. Kalland would go on to convince Bal to be his sponsor for his application to the Tower of Knowledge, on the condition that Kalland spend 2 days a month working the guild forges. 

Bal also played a role in [Grug's](/player_characters/grug) money match with [Ivar](/npcs/Ivar), collecting dues from bets made on the match and cheering along with the crowd.
