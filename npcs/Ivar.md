# Interaction with Party
Ivar was introduced to [grug](/player_characters/grug) by [Retired Sergeant Wirtham](/npcs/Retired_Sergeant_Wirtham) after Wirtham was impressed by his own fight against grug. Ivar and Grug agreed to another friendly fight and Wirtham and his other friends started gathering a crowd. Eventually a crowd of 100 people formed in the mercenary guild courtyard and a large sum of bets were placed. [Bal](/npcs/Balcadar_Brogitarius) was also present and collected dues from the bets, pleased with the easy money. Grug warmed up with Burr while Ivar stretched, and the fight began. It was a close match but Grug eventually won, netting 500gp.
