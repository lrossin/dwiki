# Description
A well manored man who used to serve in _____, because of this he runs the bandits much like a military. 

He is currently in league with the Temple of Iskara, although he himself is not a believer. As long as the money is good he'll continue raiding villages and turning over prisioners.  
# Rumors
> Drusis' Bandits are sacking and burning villages along the Viaspin Forest. There is a 25,000 GP bounty and vestiture for his head
> - Mercenary Guild
# Interaction with the Party
We raided the bandit camp but Drusis fled to the Temple of Iskara

Some of the party, posing as bandits, infilitrated the temple and met Drusis. It seems they have gained his trust for now. He plans to set out to find any men who survived the attack on his camp.
