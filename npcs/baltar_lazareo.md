# Description
A young man with considerable connections and skill with a blade. Looks like a rich prick trying to dress like a fencer, but wears excessive jewelry ruining the basic nature of fencing clothes.

# Rumours
> Despite his prowess, he tends to fight dirty and has allegedly killed at least three minor nobles in unsanctioned duels. 

> He's been on a terror lately. Looking to stick his sword in anyone.

# Interaction with Party
Praahi and Sister Darion prevented Baltar from getting violent with Eugene Balewife on the first day of the festival.
