# Description
Star pupil of [Blade Dancer Valara](/npcs/Blade_Dancer_Valara)


# Rumours
>  Zeadora recieved visions from Ianna and recently went missing.
> - Blade Dancer Valara, Temple of the Bladed Veil

> Paladin Tavish left his order to follow her, but no one has heard from him since.
> - Sage Nikolas & Subaltern Levit, Temple of the Winged Sun

# Interaction with Party
Have only heard of her recent disappearance. She had similar visions to Praahi. We hope to find some trace of her and Paladin Tavish when we head East.
