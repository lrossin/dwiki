# Rumours
>  Zeadora recieved visions from Ianna and recently went missing.

> Paladin Tavish left his order to follow her, but no one has heard from him since.
> - Sage Nikolas & Subaltern Levit, Temple of the Winged Sun

> Zeadora was traded to the Temple of Iskara one month ago by Bandit Captain Drusis. He wanted to kill her himself, but the temple was highly interested in her.

# Interaction with Party
## Temple of Ianna
Have only heard of her recent disappearance. She had similar visions to Praahi. We hope to find some trace of her and Paladin Tavish when we head East.
## Bandit Camp
She was not at the bandit camp, but we found her swords and know where she was sent. We promised Tavish we would continue looking for her.
