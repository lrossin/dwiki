NPCs that the party knows about should have pages here. Pages should include descriptions, meeting times and locations, rumours and thier sources, etc.

All pages here should contain the 'npc' tag, so that searching for it results in a list of [all NPCs](https://dwiki.whateverishere.net/t/npc?sort=title).
Pages for characters associated with a particular factions should contain a tag with that factions name.
