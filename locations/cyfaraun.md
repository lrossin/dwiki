# Descriptions
Cyfaraun is the capital of the prefecture of the Borderlands in Southern Argollë. It used to be an elven city until the Auran Empire conquered it a few hundred years ago. A lot of elven architecture is still visible in the city’s old districts. Like most Auran cities, Cyfaraun has a large sewer system, but the Cyfaraun sewers are unusualbecause they’re built in and through the ruins and rubble of an even older elven city. The local storytellers claim the city’s underground architecture encompasses everything from ancient catacombs to chthonic temples to criminal hideouts. The city’s residents tend to say that the storytellers, like the sewers, are just full of shit.
