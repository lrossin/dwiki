# Bandits 
A bounty has been placed on the party of bandits terrorizing the forest and surrounding territories. Drusis, the leader of this malevolent force, has a considerable price on his head. 

Thanks to the local critters, we have found their encampment in a quarry and begun our assault, fearsome as they may be. 


# The Altar of Mityara
An abandoned altar to Mityara, an elven Goddess of healing, allegedly rests somewhere in these treacherous woods and holds the power to remove Dirgions curse from those of us afflicted. This information was gleaned first through Galmorm, and confirmed by the Blade Dancers.

Mityara's blessing is also capable of improving the pommel of Zulban's +1 mace. 

# Misc
The north side of the forest is safer for the forest creatures as of now. It would seem the bandits have not pressed into the territory yet.

To the south east, there are abundant fruit trees, once favored by the animals residing in the forest. Many of these critters have been cut off from these orchards and forced north by the bandit threat.
