# Places of Note
## The Harliquins Mask
Home of Hugo, a rich wine from the Hugolite estates in the hills near the border between Kryea and Southern Argolle.
- It comes in a unique green bottle decorated with imagery of serpents and grape vines. It is rumored that the Serpent depiction is a nod to the peppery "Bite" their otherwise semi-sweet wines all share.
