# Places of Note
## The Harliquins Mask
Home of Hugo, a rich wine from the Hugolite estates in the hills near the border between Kryea and Southern Argolle.
- It comes in a unique green bottle decorated with imagery of serpents and grape vines. It is rumored that the Serpent depiction is a nod to the peppery "Bite" their otherwise semi-sweet wines all share.

## Noble Charter
Praahi was stationed here to protect the Sacred Courtesan during the first day of the Festival of the Sun.
- Expected very little issue, just good to have the reminder.
- A young noble (Baltar Lazero) and his onterage started making a ruckus with another young noble about bloodlines. This was resolved quickly by Praahi without any violence.

# Notable NPCs
