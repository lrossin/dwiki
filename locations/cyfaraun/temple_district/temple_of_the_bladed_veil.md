# Description
The temple is 2 stories tall, split into duel roles: Warriors (right hand of Ianna) and Cortisans (left hand of Ianna). The outside is covered in a repeating of lions and 9 pointed stars. There is a large courtyard and a 12ft tall enterance with statues on either side. One of a veiled dancer and the other a gladitorial fighter. 

Inside the air is heavy with the scent Myr and Lavender. The divine cortisans are singing, dancing, and entertainign, while the blade dancers stand guard. There is a strong sense of hospitality here. A large fountain sits in the middle of the room where people cast silver into the pool. One silver an hour is customary here. Everyone is welcome and taken care of, no threat of stealing as the curse of Ianna's wrath looms. 

Upstairs is almost entirely training rooms. Only members are allowed upstairs, unless deemed necessary.
