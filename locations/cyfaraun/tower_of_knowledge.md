We were given 3 iron stakes with unique runes. These stakes are used for scrying on important locations. Amount paid ranges from 50 - 1000 GP and is based on distance and strategic value. We must be able to describe the exact location of the stakes. The more concealed they are the longer they last.

## Kalland's Artificer Test
Kalland and 4 others are applying to the school of artifice, 3 citizens and 2 recommendations. Kalland was presented by Mercenary Guildmaster Bal, since he is not a citizen. Balador was presented by Lady Ommadar, prefect of the tower for being the top student from the schools. Have until the first day of the festival to present their 'lighter than air' themed creation. 

## Turning over Dark Magic Items
Kalland hands over the necromatic wand and duergean mask to [Amnus](), Keeper of Artifacts & Treasurer of the Tower. We speak with [Provost Menatis]() about our time in the hole and everything we found, including the writtings Praahi wrote down. He is interested in all things concerning the ancient elves and asks that we return with any other information we may uncover. He confirms the stories of the elven pool and speaks of the Yali, celestial guardians of the pool.
