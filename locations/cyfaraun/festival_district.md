*TODO:everything* List of [all locations](https://dwiki.whateverishere.net/t/location?sort=title)
# Aura
Aura is the empire in which our campaign takes place. Much of the party comes from the Meneri Mountains, Opelenea, and other areas of Aura. We have all made our way to the Borderlands.

# The Borderlands
The Borderlands are secured by a fortified line of forts. These forts have become heavily undermanned leaving the area open to attacks, but even fully manned they could never entirely secure the region. Monsters are slipping across the porous border to terrorize/plunder. Travel has grown perilous, & forts are becoming increasingly isolated and outmatched. The power structure has begun decentralized to local warlords and private armies. [Cyfaraun](/locations/cyfaraun) is the capital city
