# Description
The Old City district remains the vibrant heart of modern Cyfaraun. It is home to both the Merchants Guild Hall and the sprawling tent market of the Emporium whose riotous courtyard of ever changing merchant stalls is hemmed by some of the finest shops within the boarderland. It is said that if you can not find what you are looking for in the Emporium you simply have not looked long enough.

The Old City is also home to the Mercenary guildhall who's members provide both protection and patronage to the many merchants who travel the boarderlands.

The City Watch have made the ancient Bailey fort within the Old City thier headquarters and so the Bronze Helmed watchmen are a near constant presence.

The Mink is a popular watering hole and trade hub for travelling caravaners and its air is nearly as thick with talk of deals and contracts as it is with the spicy-sweet scent of Obscura smoke.
