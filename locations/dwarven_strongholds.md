# Description
Deep within the Mountains of Meniri lie the fire-blackened ruins of Azen Kairn. Founded by dwarves from Azen Khador during the Bitter War, it became the largest dwarven vault in the eastern Meniri Mountains after Khador was destroyed by the ArgollÃ«an elves. In 225 BE, at the height of the Beastman Wars, Azen Kairn was conquered by the great red dragon Orm and an army of beastmen. Orm has ruled there ever since, spawning a brood of lesser dragons. For five centuries, the dwarves of Azen Radokh have paid tribute to Orm, lest he unleash dragon-fire upon them, and his hoard is said to be rival the wealth of the emperor himself.
 
Azen Radokh was originally a mining outpost of Azen Kairn. When Azen Kairn fell to the dragon Orm in 225 BE, its refugees settled here and excavated a great vault. Azen Radokh sits upon a rich strata of precious metals, which fuels trade with Siadanos to the east. Sadly, much of the wealth of Azen Radokh passes south in tribute to Orm, lest the great dragon come with fire upon the last of the dwarven vaults in the east.
