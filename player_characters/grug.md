### Session 2

Me and Burr got 3 more greenskins on our own :right_facing_fist: :left_facing_fist: . Burr found out they die when you cook them and we tag teamed two big ones with everyone else. I only broke half of my bones in the process. There's still a couple goblins to weed out and the cat looks spooked but I'm ready to pick up this tiny sleeping guy I found and get out of here. Maybe he'll even be as funny as Kalland

### Session 3

It was Zulban's turn to eat dirt today :yum: . He woke up some kind of trash monster and I think I heard him say "Finally a worthy opponent!" right before he got knocked out. The cat jumped in and squirmed so hard the thing didn't know how to handle it, looked like a ball of dust, robes, and claws but it worked and the trash monster died. Me and Burr were watching over Zulban and the Halfling when the Halfling looked like he was moving. I went to shake him awake and he puffed some rainbows in my face, still not sure what that was about. Once he saw someone other than a half-orc he seemed to calm down :rolling\_eyes: . I got some shiny new armor from the cave and pulled everyone in the cart. Learned about some local forests, even one with a local dragon. Sounds like the city has some festival going on where I can fight and not get arrested, might be worth looking into.

### Session 3 (again?)

We followed barnabus to his dockside rendezvous, clearly barnabus isn't without his secrets. These guys look suspiciously nondescript and get us into the city without anyone stopping us. Makes me wonder what was in that chest of his if it was warded and needed to be smuggled into Cyfaruan, but without any kind of armed escort it can't have been that amazing. We got a place to stay in a noisy tavern and headed to the market. I saw a guy selling animals and ordered a falcon which should be ready for pickup in 2 weeks. I paid 25gp and still owe him 75 when he gets the bird. With falcon eyes I should be able to scout, hunt, and track discretely. Even in a crowded city i think a bird could tail and evesdrop without me needing to sneak at all. The sewer grates around the city seem to lead down to a large sewer network that runs up against the basements of nearby buildings. It could be used to hide if we need to avoid any guards but I bet theives use it to break into buildings from below. We're heading to the mercenary guild now for some work and maybe we'll find some way to get into the gladiator fights even though it'll be about a month before they start.

### Grug the 4th

Days until bird: 13

We signed up with the merc guild and these people are great. Kill stuff or put sticks in the wilderness and you get paid, easy. Food and beds too when you sign up. Went back to the tavern and Ganymede stumbled in and said he got robbed. Criminals in this place have no shame, robbing from the physically deformed like that. Had some stupid name like dust and skulls or something, we're setting up an ambush for the assholes tonight. I'll give em one chance to apologize and empty their pockets before introducing them to the ground. After feeding them each a handful of shit we've got some work to the south. I'm not sure if we'll try and find barnabus before then but I have a funny feeling he'll rope us into something before we leave, he talks too much to stay out of trouble.

### Grug session 6

Days till bird: 13 (12?)

We planned our ambush which went off the road immediately. I was using a rat, which i named Ratothy, as my eyes above ground while i was in the sewers, but there was something down there with me. I managed to sneak out and used Ratothy to see some kind of lizard people in the sewers. I knew Cyfaraun was basically a city on a city but i didn't expect the city underneath to come complete with its own people. I found a new place to hide and returned Ratothy back to the surface, maybe he'll put in a good word for me with the other city rats. Prahii tried to get the jump on them against our plan but immediately bit the dust because of it. Its clear that without me and Burr to take the hits the rest of my companions cant stay standing long. One gang member got away so we'll have to be careful in the city moving forward. There's a 250 gold bounty for the guys we got and we'll have to check with the guards while we're collecting to see if that gang has any territory that we should be avoiding. I'll be sleeping at the mercenary guild from now on. We're staying in the city to check out some dead body situation and meet back up with Barnabas. We've already made a good amount of gold so maybe it'll be worth sticking around the city but I'm sick of the crowds and cramped alleys already

### Grug session 7

Days till bird: 12

Turns out Barnabas works with the dusty butts gang or whatever. It's a pretty funny coincidence if not a bit annoying. Barnabas' friend is working to set up a meeting with the boss of the gang so we can hopefully call a truce before things get out of hand. I'm sure we can get out of this mess, especially since Barnabas must've given a glowing report about our ability to turn large monsters into a fine paste. It likely won't be worth pursuing a blood fued against our group considering the fact we don't want to fight and we could be a valuable asset. Praahi also mentioned that she has had several visions about evil and mutants on the path to T. tems. We'll stop by the place on the way to T. Tems and check if this is real or if it's just something she ate. Must be nice getting directions from god. In the mean time we're checking out the dead body situation at that river which has naturally lead us to the sewers somehow. Ganymede says that there were some hooded guys with some corpses down in the sewers under the bridge and we're all checking it out now. Cities are fuckin weird

### Grug session 8

Days till bird: 12

We tracked the people in the sewers to a group of undead. Kalland ran up and down the tunnel, lifting skeletons skulls off of their bodies like it was some kind carnival game and a hidden door opened with undead cultists inside yelling about their shrine. Inside the hidden door we found a hole that we couldn't see the bottom of, I tossed a cultist in and couldn't hear him hit the bottom. Maybe we could drop one of those tower of knowledge spikes in it and get some pay, "bottomless hole" sounds like a place of interest to me. After grabbing the horns of a big monster while everyone else dismantled it we captured the lady that looks like the leader of this mess. I dont think these guys are responsible for the dead bodies in the river since they raise the dead. Maybe they're involved somehow but either way its time to get some answers but normal torture or interrogation wont work on a person that probably welcomes death, good thing there's the hole.

### Grug session 9

Days till bird: 11

Like I thought, these cultists dont have anything to do with the dead bodies in the river. The priestess said they just collect the dead bodies and that they're "preparing" for something. Doesn't look like they're preparing particularly well considering the state of their living quarters, if you could even call it that. Even compared to the bear den this is pretty pathetic, whole religion sounds like a scam. We're planning to go down the hole but before that we needed to turn this lady into the guards. I normally wouldn't want to but killing he seems like it'd be more of an inconvenience for her than anything. On our way out we ran into a giant crocodile and it's offspring. The little one's were pretty fragile despite their size but the big one was strong enough to pull Burr underwater like it was nothing. It swam away after taking a beating which was good because plan B was feeding it that priestess. We'll need some way to pull it out of the water if we want to put it down but it's too big for me to grapple. After sleeping on the surface we went back down to decend into the hole. I've never done something like this before and I'm excited to see what we find but why did it have to be in this damn sewer...

### Grug session 10

Bird day: 11

Nothing is as it seems in this place. I took a javelin toss at what I thought were regular bats and got us attacked by a swarm of twisted undead bats. The space opens into a temple of elven design with several "tombs" buried within the walls. Are they tombs if they're full of things that are still kicking? Between fake walls, sleeping gas, and talking doors there's got to be something of value down here. The more i see of Dirigion the happier I am that we're destroying his temples, nature is the highest beauty and he twists it into stinking monsters.

### Grug session 12

Days till bird: 11

Me and Praahi seem to be the only ones taking any degree of caution in this place. Only difference is she cares enough about the others to get hurt when the boys do something dumb. Kalland has been hounded by wraiths ever since he took a finger off a statue, the door sealed off when we came in, and there have been several avoidable near death experiences. Everyone but Zulban and I got cursed by a floating skull and Ganymede had the bright idea to shoot it. Well it shot back and nearly killed everyone. After using my secret tactic of "closing the fucking door" we escaped and found out the people who were cursed can freely leave the chapel area. I'm not planning on becoming "one of Dirigion's own" but im not sure if I have a choice... or if that skull won't just throw another fireball at us if we try. Hopefully Kalland can tell whats happening now that he can see through the darkness

### Grug session 13

Days till bird: 10

My hunch was right, between kalland and ganymede they figured out how the spell worked. Me and zulban just needed to sleep our way through the wall and wake up once the others got us to the surface. Im still spinning a little from the incense I smelt to fall asleep but today's been a good day regardless. I got to wrestle a retired Sargeant at the guild hall, win some money, and toast to both of our skill. He said that I'd do well in the festival tournament. I didn't clue him into my trouble in festival district but I definitely want to sign up. We'll have to resolve our conflict with that gang if we want to have any fun in town. Add it to the list with fighting crocodiles, breaking curses, dropping spikes, and fighting bandits.
