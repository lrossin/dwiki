# Diary

### Star date: session two

We pushed onward into the goblins lair, deep beneath the bridge. Grug and Prahi pressed on across a rancid pit, I opted to follow them across while Kalland and Zulban pressed through a secret passage plugged by a boulder. Once inside, we found the hoard of monsters that assaulted the wagon and butchered the creatures it carried. Despite their numbers and their size, they proved to be no match for our party. It was discovered by chance that fire prevented these hideous creatures from healing; the logs burning beneath their stew quickly led to their demise. We found a little man, beaten and picked over, bound to a log in the depths of the troll chiefs cave. Why was he spared? Were his comrades and their mounts well cooked? Would it be wasteful to leave the stew? Is it safe to rest here and allow Grug to regain her strength? These are the questions still gnawing on my mind. The drums of battle may have momentarily stopped, but uncertainty and danger still linger in the vast chasm.

### Session Three

The chumps I'm traveling with just led me to an incredible treasure horde. Not only did they offer to carry the heavy bits out, but they handled the terrible monster that lurked down here too. Their screams and anguish filled the caves, but didn't seem to draw out any other creatures for me to butcher. Among the loot was a number of ornate trinkets, mask, mug, cat. Perhaps the most intriguing is this puzzle box; when shaken it rattles with possibilities, but I have yet to crack it. The halfling prisoner woke up and explained that his ability to deceive his captors is all that kept him alive. He has offered us a route to the city, along the river, and even offered to cover our lodging for the trek. This tavern is quite nice and the patrons seem to be merchants. Methinks this may be a nice opportunity to try on a new face and take what is theirs.

### Session Five

*Written on his bed, under a blanket fort for privacy and security*

Yesterday three thugs mugged me. *a tear blots the page* They took my gold and shoved sand in my mouth. Watch captain Varryk(?) Tells me it was the work of Sand and Bone, a notorious band of local thugs. Real clever, leaving a calling card in their victims mouth. Well, tonight we will form a new crew and call ourselves the ShitKickers! I want to be very clear about something, these pieces of garbage, they don't know who the hell they're dealing with. Soon we will hammer down on them in a terrible storm of fists.

IT CAME TO AN ALTAR. THERE SERVANTS OF THE DARK LORD WERE PREPARING A RITE DEICATED TO THE HORNED RAT. GALMORM. HIS ALCOLYTES ARE MANY. THEIR STRENGTH IS SINCERE. I FEEL THAT I MUST FIND THEM IF I AM TO GROW STRONGER. THE SEWERS BENEATH THE MERCHANTS DISTRICT SEEM WELL TRODDEN. I WONDER IF THE INHABITANTS KNOW ANYTHING OF THE ANCIENT UNDERGROUND THAT HOUSES THE ALTAR FROM MY VISION. I WILL HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS IN THIS ENDEAVOR." =25%x)
