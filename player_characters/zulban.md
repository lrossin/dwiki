# Background
## Religion
Zulban worships the exalted soul of a great warrior in the history of his clan, named Ingish. This warriors soul lingers in the arms(great axe) he used in the battles in which he fought and performed the deeds(fighting/dying gloriously defeating a great foe) that made him worthy of worship. These monuments are held within the vaults of Azen Radokh where Zulban spent most of his life dedicated to defending while in the militia. Defending the mountainhome, and in turn the vaults where religious artifacts are held, is how he pays tribute to Ingish, as well as pays respect to all of the exalted ancestors who's souls reside in other monuments in Azen Radokh.
