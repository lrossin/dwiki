# Background
It’s been 6 years since I left home and found my blade sisters. Over the last 6 years, I have trained hard to learn the ways of the sword dancers and of the lioness, Ianna. If it weren’t for Evalyn teaching me to channel my anger, I probably would’ve ended up a criminal. I owe everything to her and Ianna, they gave me strength. It's hard to believe I have to leave them already.

A week ago I had a vision during my daily meditations. I stood in darkness, a cave, the world around me was cool and calm. Then everything began to tremble violently, I could hear and feel earth and stone tearing apart. Just as the thought of the space collapsing in on me, burying me in rubble the shaking suddenly stopped and all was still again... for a moment. I felt it before I truly perceived it. A throbbing like the beating of a heart. This heart was not my own, however, it was there in the darkness with me. It was feint at first,  I had to strain to hear it but with each beat, it grew stronger, louder, until the rhythm began to crash in my ears filling me with righteous anger. I wanted nothing more than to grasp it and tear it apart in my hands but I could not find it. I stalked the darkness as the noise grew and a red blow like a coal ember taunted me on the horizon. I began to realize I was not hunting it any longer it was hunting me. It sent dark thick sinewy tendrils lashing out trying to take hold of me. I fought tooth and claw but they were gaining ground. I was exhausted, I was afraid, and then a roar shook my body and filled the void. All was white and heat for an instant. I awoke, the heart was out of reach somewhere in the darkness... somewhere to the East.

I told my blade-mother, Evalyn of this dream. How real it felt, how the anger felt like a fire in my soul, and the Roar of the Lioness which rescued me from despair. I told this story three more times until I stood before the Mistress of the temple herself. She kissed my forehead and told me that Ianna had tasked me with a great purpose. I must go and seek this heart in darkness and face my fear. Before setting out in search of the heart, Evalyn gifted me the Claw of Ianna. Usually, this signifies the completion of your training, yet Evalyn decided to give me the sword early to help me on my quest.
 
I am still struggling to understand what this omen could mean. All I remember is this beating heart in the darkness, with sinewy tendrils hunting me, but yesterday I had another vision. This time it felt like I was there at this tavern between the city and Tor Tem. The tavern was on fire and surrounded by beastmen and mutated humans. They took many prisoners, I can only assume to mutate them as well. This must be related to my first vision, I’m just not sure how. I think we should set out towards Tor Tem as soon as possible to check out this tavern and what is out there. Something evil is afoot here and I can’t stop it alone.

# Journal
## The Troll Cave (Session 3)
We set out early in the morning from the travel house we’d been staying at, fog covered the path making it difficult to see. We followed the river, but I had an eerie feeling. I kept my eye on the forest, as bandits and beastmen are known to lurk around these parts. Even the couple at the travel house warned us of the dwindling patrols in the area. As per usual Ganymede, Kalland, and Zulban stuck towards the back. Ganymede always looking for poisonous insect/plants and Zulban just trying to keep Kalland from getting lost, while watching our back. Grug, being more intune with the wilderness decided to lead today.

Grug could see wagon tracks ahead of us, likely travellers from earlier in the day,  meanwhile Ganymede is collecting insects with Zulban’s help. Luckily the woods were clear and we weren’t in a rush. As we made our way to the bridge we could just make out 4 figures in the mist and an overturned cart. They were about 100ft out, two smaller figures and two larger. Ganymede and I decided to sneak up to get a closer look. The two smaller figures were frantically unloading the cart, while the larger figures were armed and standing guard. Then I noticed blood on the bridge, and claw marks on the wagon.

I decided to relay the information to the rest of the group before alerting the creatures to our presence. A fight ensued, but these big creatures seemed too dumb to die! Our only option was to toss them in the river. Meanwhile, Grug had gone under the bridge chasing a goblin, in her pursuits she fell down a flight of stairs hidden in the brush. We eventually follow and found ourselves in the middle of a Troll Cave. 

Grug really got into a mess down there. I climbed across the wall to help her out since it was faster than the secret path. There were just so many goblins/trolls/trollkin. Luckily Burr dropped a trollkin in the fire and that seemed to work. Burr really is the backbone of the team. At least now we know that fire prevents Trolls and Tollkin from healing. I don’t think we would’ve made it out alive otherwise.

While exploring the cave I found a halfling that was actually still alive! I had lost hope after seeing that stew … so that's a success I suppose. I think we should get out of here soon though. We might have defeated the Trolls, but I think there is something far worse hiding in here. When I entered the room to the North, i felt a strong hunger and heard gnashing teeth. 

Eventhough Grug is pretty beat up Zulban and Kalland still insisted on going North. I joined them in hopes of keeping everyone safe. I’m glad I went because I don’t think Zulban and Kalland would have survived without me. It did cost Kalland his dog and we almost lost Zulban. Once we defeated the monster I left Zulban, the halfling, and Kalland in Grugs care while I hunted down Ganymede

Eventually I heard Ganymede calling for help with his loot. I joined him on the other side of the cave to collect things. Although looking for loot while we are fighting is deplorable, he did share the loot with the group, maybe this is someone I can trust, just not in a fight. On our way back it seems the halfling, Barnabas had finally woken up. A bit startled by Grug, he eventually found he could trust us. 

## Countryside Inn (Session 3)
We fixed up Barnabas' wagon and loaded it back up with what was left of his honey and his chest. We continued on our journey toward Cyfaraun, now with the inside scoop of where to go and who to talk to, thanks to Barnabas. He even knew of the local blade dancer temple. 

We made it to an inn for the night and split up our treasure from the cave. I got a cat-eye gem, which I hope to make a necklace out of, and an odd-looking stone cat head. After having the stone for a while I realized it was magical and seemed to be good luck. Most of the loot was coin, which we split equally, and art pieces we plan to sell. Interestingly there is a puzzle box that seems to contain something. I’m not very good at puzzles but maybe one of the others can figure it out.

While we ate and drank at the inn I decided to talk with some other travelers. The group was made up of 2 merchants, 2 passengers, and 4 guards. The passengers, Nefric and Loris Olminer were coming from Aura to visit their cousin. Apparently, they have “a number of interests in the city” they want to check on. They didn’t really clarify, but they must be important if they are traveling with 4 guards. They seem a bit pompous and elitist, but were keen to gossip and who am I to say no? 

According to the siblings the wizard, Regent Aures Ambador, was sent to oversee the Chapter House (Cyfraun’s Tower of Knowledge). Since the capital city’s tower is the only ‘true’ tower of knowledge he must’ve done something to be sent away. Additionally, they warned me not to trust him, as he is hiring and sending people to their deaths in the waste. While telling this story, the local merchants, seemed less convinced.
## Travel to Cyfaraun (Session 4)
We set out around 8:00 AM after morning beers. It's another misty morning, but Barnabas seems to know where he’s going. We follow him to meet his business associates to get passage to the Festival District. We veer off the path a bit and head to the docks, where about 6 people are waiting. They seem hesitant at our arrival, especially Grug, but Barnabas does his best to ensure them that we are friends. They seem surprised that Barnabas expected them to ferry us as well. As they load the cart onto the barge, Barnabas negotiated our passage as well. He seems a bit frazzled after that encounter, hopefully we didn’t cause him too much trouble. 

While we travel along the Miren River, which transects the city, we get to know the crew a bit. They seem intentionally nondescript, but clearly travel this route often. We begin to realize that their helping their employer avoid taxes on goods. They covered all the goods with hay and filled the cart with sacks of grain. We were quickly waved through by the tower and none of the patrol boats stopped us. Eventually we landed at the docks in the Festival Ward.

We quickly split ways with Barnabas, but we should be meeting back up with him at the Silk Pony in a few days. His boss might reward us for returning him and his goods unscathed. Until then we decided to stay at the Half Full Tanker, a nearby inn/tavern that is extremely cheap. ONLY 5GP/WEEK!!! Although cheap I look forward to better accommodations in the future. 

## First Day in Cyfaraun (Session 4/5)
Kalland, Grug, Zulban, and I set off to the market to do some shopping. Ganymede again elected to be alone and separate from the group … On our journey, we crossed a large bridge with a street magician. He was magnificent, forming figures with colorful smoke, I’d never seen such beautiful magic! He had a small imp running around spreading local gossip about travelers from Aura failing in the Borderlands. The stories quickly remind me of the travelers we met at the countryside inn. Perhaps they are destined to fail here too. 

After a while, we find the market. The colorful, bustling market reminded me of the markets in Opalinia. I even found a shop that carried exotic curiosities, including a statue of Ianna from back home. It’s difficult to see Ianna pictured as a human in the city. It’s nice to have a keepsake of her lioness form I am used to. The others seemed to find some interesting goods as well. Grug even bought a bird!

## The Mercenary Guild (Session 5)
Most of us signed up for the Mercenary Guild and the tasks seems pretty doable. I'm especially pleased we can work on 2 assignments at the same time. They offer free lodging and death benefits for all members, which is pretty nice. All the people there look fairly well off, I hope we can start making some money soon. It sounds like these jobs will get us out of the city, maybe I’ll find out more information about my vision, especially if we head east. 

It seems Ganymede has gotten himself into some trouble while we were out and now he wants to drag us into it to. I'm sorry he got mugged, but I'm not sure if we should start a fight with a gang this soon. Hopefully, this ambush plan doesn't come back to bite us. Maybe if we find their hideout and place a spike there, this could be worthwhile. I'm sure there is a bounty for some of these gang members as well.

While they set up their ambush Kalland and I went to the Temple of Knowledge to set up our Mercenary work with them. They have an extensive library, I wonder if I can learn more about what my vision meant and where to go next. Kalland seems excited, he may become a member of the Tower of Knowledge, gaining access to the Articifer lab. I can only imagine what crazy things he will come up with/make in there. I'm not sure if I want to tell him about my vision quite yet, but I need someone with access to the library.

Guess it's time to head back to the Festival District and see where this ambush is going to take place. I really hope they know what they are doing, making enemies in the city on our second day here …


Guess its time to head back to the Festival District and see where this ambush is going to take place.

## A New Vision (Session 6)
I had another vision. This time the message wasn’t hidden behind omens and symbolism. It was like I was there, watching the town folk get rounded up. Something bad is happening here, those creatures were … human?! Who or what could be causing these mutations and why are they collecting more people? Is this happening all over the Borderlands?! I think I’ll need to start telling my traveling companions about my mission and the visions Ianna has bestowed me with. If this is happening in real-time, we will need to take action quickly!

> Listen guys there’s something you don’t know about why I came to the city. I had a vision before we met, an omen of sorts that something evil was to the east. The goddess Ianna saved me from this evil but has tasked me with stopping it. 
I am still struggling to understand what this omen could mean. All I remember is this beating heart in the darkness, with sinewy tendrils hunting me, but yesterday I had another vision. This time it felt like I was there at this tavern between the city and Tor Tem. The tavern was on fire and surrounded by beastmen and mutated humans. They took many prisoners, I can only assume to mutate them as well. This must be related to my first vision, I’m just not sure how. I think we should set out towards Tor Tem as soon as possible to check out this tavern and what is out there. Something evil is afoot here and I can’t stop it alone.

## The Ambush & Consequences (Session 6/7)
After a short time at the inn, we set out to the tavern Weary’s Rest. It seems the gang has picked the perfect place for an ambush. Although its not something I want to make a habit of in the city, I’m glad they thought out the plan thoroughly. Unfortunately, I got knocked out quickly, which allowed one of the spies to escape. Now the gang knows my face, which could be problematic. Sadly, we didn’t get any leads on their hideout, but we did receive our first bounty reward. 

I wonder if there is some mercenary work in the city we could work on before heading out to Tor Tem. Someone has to be interested in the dead bodies showing up in the Bridge District. Grug even mentioned Lizard Folk in the sewer, seems there is much to learn about this new city we have arrived in.

## Sewer Temple of Duergean (Session 13)
Well I'm glad somebody knows how to use magic ... I dragged Grug to the surface and hung out until she woke up, even made her an antitoxin poltice to help. She really inhaled alot of those incense. Im happy to be back on the surface and away from that necromantic energy, except I can still feel it. This veil blocking me from Ianna. My sisters at the temple did their best to help me, but to no avail. I did learn that another blade daughter had similar visions, but she disappeared. I hope I dont meet the same fate. For now we need to head South and find this ancient pool of healing. Sounds like our only chance to cleanse our souls of this mark. As a bonus we were already headed that way! How hard can it be to find a long lost elven shine in the bandit filled woods?!

## Training Arc (Session 14)
Its scary to think that someone with higher skill than myself disappeared after having the same visions. If I am going to head toward Tor Tem, and that inn from my vision I’ll need to learn more and train harder. I hope to work my way up in rank before I’m faced with this greater evil, for now I will train with my fellow blade-dancers. It seems I still have much to learn, just being fast isn’t enough anymore. 

It seems Grugs training proved much more fruitful. She is now known as the Heavy Weight Champ of the Mercenary guild, news has already spread through the city and folks are interested in recruiting her for jobs and the gladiatorial arena. 

Kallands training has also paid off he’s made it to the final 3 for the Artificer School, now he just needs to invent something lighter than air before opening ceremonies in 1 weeks time. Kalland also turned in the dark magic item we found, possibly as a bribe to get it?

It seems Provost Menatis studies the ancient elves and is grateful for the information we’ve uncovered so far. He may be a great ally as we continue on our journey. He even gives us more information of the pool we seek. Celestial Fighters called Yali protect the pool as long as we are good of heart and have no ill intention they should allow us to enter.

## Training Arc 2 (Session 15)
During the week leading up to the festival, I decided to continue my training. I met with Blade Sister Beladora. She trained me in the way of the archer. The first 3 days I never touched a bow, instead we focused on the mindset. To increase my patience and perception we often meditated. Afterwards we did a city walk. Beladora asked me questionsof the small details she noticed, and the importance of taking notice of distant things and possible threats. Finally I was able to pick up a bow. She shot 12 plates into the air, but I only had 10 arrows. A true archer would be able to hit all 12. I only hit 9, but she was impressed with my growth in such a short time. At the end of training Beladora gifted me 4 sacred arrows.

During my training I met Blade Sister Solfinia Geldius. She is a minor noble South of the city. She was one of Zeadora's closest friends. When we spoke of her disappearance it seemed like she was holding back. I eventually aproached her, told her of my visions and that I plan to look for Zeadora during my travels. Despite my good intentions, she swore an oath to keep certain knowledge private. I decided to mention Tavish, this got her attention. She tried to avoid eye contact, eventually give up a bit of what she knew. After telling me she avoided me, partially out of shame.
> I know Tavish Drakomir would never hurt Zeadora. I can't say the same of his family.

## Festival Week (Session 15)
The tower of knowlege was perfectly white and gleamed in the sunlight. The tower is only outdone by the glistening golden dome of the Temple of Amanar. The group split up to take on different tasks for the day. I decided to do some work for the temple.

### Bodyguarding in the Lake District
I was assigned to protect the Sacred Courtisans at the Noble Charter in the Lake District. The sisters of the veil provide comfort through massage, music, and dancing. No issues are expected, but the added reminder is always good to have. This is where Zeadora would normally be posted. 

A young noble and his entourage began making a ruckus, trying to pick a fight with another noble of bloodlines. Although they were not threatening the Sacred Courtisans, this put me on edge. I asked Sister Danon if we should intervene, I'm not used to interacting with nobles.She assured me that any action was up to our discretion, in the city we can carry out justice within reason to ensure safety. Although there is no immediate thread it will look poorly on us if the situation ends in bloodshed because we intervened or failed to. I decided to take a cautious approach and post myself directly next to the young noble. I think I intimidated him and the situation was diffused. 

While in the company of nobles I picked up on some whispers between them. Some was commentary on saving Eugene Balewife from Baltar Lazero. Apparently Baltar has been on quite the terror lately and has been solving disputes with his sword. Many of the nobles discussed the current poltical situation. Many of them believe Prefect Basilio has gone mad. He sees threats everywhere and has begun hiring assassins on merchants suspected of smuggling. 

### Gladitorial Arena Beast Fight
It is the day of the beast fight and the arena is full of spectators. Grug, Zulban and I had no idea what we would be facing. The High Mage of Divination ensured fairness of the games and safety of patrons. A magical dome surrounded the arena and all participants were checked to be under no magical influence. When we entered the arena there were rocks scattered across the field. Then they released the chimera. The chimera was caught in the Istrich Forest and had been terrorizing Tor Aura. It had 3 heads, that of a goat, lion, and red dragon. I did my usual hit and run which was not a hit with the crowd, I dont think they even noticed when I landed a hit. The crowd really lost their minds at the end when Zulban landed a finishing blow on the red dragon head. A true dwarven victory as many saw the red dragon head as a representation of the oppressive red dragon currently ruling the dwarves. We each recieved a silver laurel with the date, giving us prestige when we wear it.

## Shit Hit the Fan (Session 16)
After a sucessful match in the gladitorial arena, I went to celebrate with my sisters and rest while the others caught another fight. Everyone was celebrating and having a good time at the temple until 4 prefecture guards appeared in the early evening. They asked for Valara, stating that the prefect needed her council IMMEDIATELY.

I went to Beladora, one of Valra's second in command to find out any information. She didn't know what was happeneing, but it can only mean there is a threat to the city. In true Beladora fashion she advised me to be patient and not to limit my focus to my vision, but don't rule them out as connected either. 

I left the temple shortly after to meet up with the group at the Mercenary's Guild to figure out our next move. Many of the temples we stirring. The paladins of the Winged Sun joined the bolstered city watch. Both lightly armed and heavily armed folks could be seen throught the city. Something big was going on, it just isn't clear what. 

More and more people began to return to the Mercenary Guild. Many different accounts of the situation were being discussed. Eventually Bal returned to confirm the stories.

> A dragon with purple flames attacked Ceadonace at sunset last night. those touched by the flames were reformed as monsterous creatures and began attacking their neighbors

> Increased troll folk and wyvern are making their way to the borderforts along the river between the wastes.

> Ogres and hillgiants have come down the mountain and are attacking Tor Tel

> The Bandit Drusis is sacking and burning villages along the Viaspen Forest. Making it difficult to combat army in the front, drusis in the back, and aerial attacks. 25,000 Gold & Vestiture for the group that brings back Drusis' head.

> Troops of city guard, led by paladins are managing the undead threat. Our recent efforts in the sewers increased patrols, allowing Cyfaraun to manage the undead attacks.

We immediately headed to the docks to charter a boat down the lake tothe Viaspen Forest. Luckily, the guards at the docks recognized Grug from her recent work down there and offer to bring us on their trip to Tor Orn as added muscle. The only stipulations were that they were leaving now and it'd be a one way trip. We quickly boarded for the 8hr trip to Tor Orn. 

Once we landed we quickly made our way to the edge of the Viaspin Forest. We decided to stay on the road and check out the villages close by for any signs of trouble, or recently ransaked villages. We came across the burned remains of a village. Was likely destroyed in the last 48hrs, we could see movement within the reminant structures. When we investigated we found 3 opportunistic creatures feasting on remains. We fought them off until they flew back into the woods. There were no signs of survivors but we did find tracks.

It looks like a group of 30 bandits attacked. They took their dead with them and any survivors in wagons. Some survivors were forced to walk. They have at least a day on us, but at least we have a lead. 

## Closing in on the Bandit Camp (Session 17/18)
We followed the wagon trail to a cave where they had stashed the wagons and continued on foot. We decided to set up camp there for the night and were awoken by Bunteloaf after Grug disappeared into the moonlight. She was lured out by snake like women, but luckily we stopped them. My sword seemed to react to killing one of the snake like creatures, I wonder what that could mean.

The next morning we set out after the tracks. It seemed that groups of 5 split off from the main group. We decided to follow the main tracks, as they likely led directly to the camp. Eventually we were ambushed by bandits hiding in the woods and a giant. Luckily we defeated them, but this must mean we are getting close! We should proceed more carefully moving forward.

When looting the bandits we found a map on cured hyde. The map depicted the location of the camp and nearby towns to raid. It seems we are only a few miles from the camp itself. There seems to be another symbol on the map to the southeast, but we aren't sure what it indicates.

Grug decided to consult some woodland creatures to get a better understanding of the local area and the foes we may face. A doe approaches her warning us of large creatures, bigger than Grug and wolves. The doe explains that many folks live near the stream to the south now and only the northwood is safe. The doe also spoke of fruit trees to the southeast that are no longer safe to graze.

## Battle at the Bandit Camp (Session 19)
As we head toward the camp there are many tracks, including large wolf tracks. I ran up ahead of the group and scouted for about an hour. There are 2 watchtowers with movement inside and an ogre and direwolf guarding each. There are bridges at each watchtower, one heading to a quarry with a 3rd watchtower and another larger bridge to the north with a building. The palacade fort is across the northern bridge. The sound of the stream covers most noise making it easier to sneak up on them.

I returned to my compaignions and explained the situation. Despite my best effort it seems some of us were too loud to go unnoticed. A great battle broke out, but luckily we all survived and took control of the 2 towers. More ogres and dire wolves joined the battle but they were not match for a giant Grug!

## Raiding the Camp (Session 20)
It seems anyone still at the camp fled including captain Drusis, the coward. All the barricks and stables were empty, but it was clear they left in a hurry. 

At the center of the camp is a 6ft tall stone obalisk smeared with blood. The building also had an alter with a figurine made of flesh and bone and offerings. Likely belongs to those mutated necromancers we saw defending the towers. The figurine surged with necromantic magic, we decided to confiscate it for the tower of knowledge, plopping it into the bag of holding.

We also discovered a cellar used to store many things. Here we found more magical items.
