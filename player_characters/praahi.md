# Background
> Listen guys there’s something you don’t know about why I came to the city. I had a vision before we met, an omen of sorts that something evil was to the east. The goddess Ianna saved me from this evil but has tasked me with stopping it. 
> I am still struggling to understand what this omen could mean. All I remember is this beating heart in the darkness, with sinewy tendrils hunting me, but yesterday I had another vision. This time it felt like I was there at this tavern between the city and Tor Tem. The tavern was on fire and surrounded by beastmen and mutated humans. They took many prisoners, I can only assume to mutate them as well. This must be related to my first vision, I’m just not sure how. I think we should set out towards Tor Tem as soon as possible to check out this tavern and what is out there. Something evil is afoot here and I can’t stop it alone.

# Journal
### Praahi Session2
Grug really got into a mess. I climbed across the wall to help her out, since it was faster than the secret path. There were just so many goblins/trolls/trollkin. Luckily Burr dropped a trollkin in the fire and that seemed to work. Burr really is the backbone of the team. 
I found a halfling that was actually alive so thats a success I suppose. I think we should get out of here soon though. There's something even worse lurking deeper in and Grug isn't looking too good.
### Praahi Journal, Session 3
After I warned them of the creature lurking to the North, they still insisted on checking it out. I joined them in hopes of keeping everyone safe. I’m glad I went because I don’t think Zulban and Kalland would have survived without me. It did cost Kalland his dog and I was surprisingly found of Sir Buntaloaf.

Its difficult to keep up with everyone. Just as that fight wrapped up, 
Ganymede was calling for help with his loot. I joined him on the other side of the cave to collect things. He surprisingly shared his loot with the group, maybe this is someone I can trust.

I am glad Barnabas is alright and has helped us on our journey, giving us the inside scoop of where to go in the city and who to talk to. He even knew of the local blade dancer temple. We made it to an inn, but the people staying here seem a bit pretentious. Are all people from Ora like this? I hope people in Cyfaraun aren’t as bad, I’m not used to city people.
### Praahi, Session 5
Most of us signed up for the Mercenary Guild and the tasks seems pretty doable. I'm especially pleased we can work on 2 assignments at the same time. It seems Ganymede has gotten himself into some trouble while we were out and now he wants to drag us into it to. I'm sorry he got mugged, but I'm not sure if we should start a fight with a gang this soon. Hopefully this ambush plan doesn't come back to bite us. Maybe if we find their hideout and place a spike there, this could be worthwhile. I'm sure there is a bounty for some of these gang members as well.

While they set up their ambush Kalland and I went to the Temple of Knowledge to set up our Mercenary work with them. They have an extensive library, I wonder if I can learn more about what my vision meant and where to go next. Kalland seems excited, he may become a member of the Tower of Knowledge, gaining access to the Articifer lab. I can only imagine what crazy things he will come up with/make in there. I'm not sure if I want to tell him about my vision quite yet, but I need someone with access to the library.

Guess its time to head back to the Festival District and see where this ambush is going to take place.
### Praahi Session 6
I had another vision. This time the message wasn’t hidden behind omens and symbolism. It was like I was there, watching the town folk get rounded up. Something bad is happening here, those creatures were … human?! Who or what could be causing these mutations and why are they collecting more people? Is this happening all over the Borderlands?! I think I’ll need to start telling my traveling companions about my mission and the visions Ianna has bestowed me with. If this is happening in real-time, we will need to take action quickly!

After a short time at the inn, we set out to the tavern Weary’s Rest. It seems the gang has picked the perfect place for an ambush. Although its not something I want to make a habit of in the city, I’m glad they thought out the plan thoroughly. Unfortunately, I got knocked out quickly, which allowed one of the spies to escape. Now the gang knows my face, which could be problematic. Sadly, we didn’t get any leads on their hideout, but we did receive our first bounty reward. 

I wonder if there is some mercenary work in the city we could work on before heading out to Tor Tem. Someone has to be interested in the dead bodies showing up in the Bridge District. Grug even mentioned Lizard Folk in the sewer, seems there is much to learn about this new city we have arrived in.
### Praahi Session 13
Well I'm glad somebody knows how to use magic ... I dragged Grug to the surface and hung out until she woke up, even made her an antitoxin poltice to help. She really inhaled alot of those incense. Im happy to be back on the surface and away from that necromantic energy, except I can still feel it. This veil blocking me from Ianna. My sisters at the temple did their best to help me, but to no avail. I did learn that another blade daughter had similar visions, but she disappeared. I hope I dont meet the same fate. For now we need to head South and find this ancient pool of healing. Sounds like our only chance to cleanse our souls of this mark. As a bonus we were already headed that way! How hard can it be to find a long lost elven shine in the bandit filled woods?!
### Praahi Session 14: Training Arc
Its scary to think that someone with higher skill than myself disappeared after having the same visions. If I am going to head toward Tor Tem, and that inn from my vision I’ll need to learn more and train harder. I hope to work my way up in rank before I’m faced with this greater evil, for now I will train with my fellow blade-dancers. It seems I still have much to learn, just being fast isn’t enough anymore. 

It seems Grugs training proved much more fruitful. She is now known as the Heavy Weight Champ of the Mercenary guild, news has already spread through the city and folks are interested in recruiting her for jobs and the gladiatorial arena. 

Kallands training has also paid off he’s made it to the final 3 for the Artificer School, now he just needs to invent something lighter than air before opening ceremonies in 1 weeks time. Kalland also turned in the dark magic item we found, possibly as a bribe to get it?

It seems Provost Menatis studies the ancient elves and is grateful for the information we’ve uncovered so far. He may be a great ally as we continue on our journey. He even gives us more information of the pool we seek. Celestial Fighters called Yali protect the pool as long as we are good of heart and have no ill intention they should allow us to enter.
