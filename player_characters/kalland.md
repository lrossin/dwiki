### Boondiggles adventurers guide to the Borderlands vol 3: 
Survival Tip 1: Avoid Trash 

following Zulban(after things in the cavern seemed to have calmed down), he stumbles into a pit while searching for a cowardly Goblin. Then seemingly out of nowhere a big trash monster pops out and attacks zulban. big spiky tentacles and appendages start thrashing about zulban is shaken and wavers. i knew we were in trouble once it got one up on the mighty dwarf. Praahi and I jump in to back up our battleforged cleric. The trash seemed to overwhelmingly powerful. Zulban and my poor poor Bunty were knocked unconscious. seeing the broken pieces of my best and closest friend I lost the heart to battle. Words cannot express how lost I feel without my trusted steed and companion. Luckily Praahi was present, and with her immense reflexes and skills in battle. she bested the trash monster saving Zulban, bunty and myself from certain death.

Survival Tip 2: Win the day, save the girl, save the world and drink copious amounts of mead.

After my heroic display on the trash panda. I  stumbled upon an emerald lodged into a hilt with no blade. After collecting ourselves(and scattered pieces of bunt) we talked with a peculiar little halfling Barnabis. We began to set off towards the city Cyfaruan. During the night we found rest at a very small but nice inn. We relaxed and loosened up our achy joints with a few drinks. Still shaken that a mighty warrior like Zulban was taken down so effortlessly, I decided to ask him to see his shield. I began working my little fingers to infuse some of my magic into the shield. With thoughts of Zulbans god in mind I buff his shield to always keep him safe.
### Session 14: Test of Knowledge
today is the day of my test to get into the tower of knowledge. The grounds are booming with festivities, magic and shops galore. Upon arriving I find a nice salesman with trinkets, odds and ends that sort of thing. He shows me a peculiar marble, a marble of location. I couldn't help myself and spent a good chunk of my "savings" on it. 

With the tests starting I gather with all the fellow craftsman and mages. Though I'm quite confident in myself and my craft, I cant help but feel nervous knowing only one from each school will be chosen to get in. As well as the lucky fellow chosen by Arius Ambador the head of the tower. With things starting up we separate into our schools judged by the proctors and masters of each school. The Chapter master of the school of Artificer is Yorik Provoli a human in his fifties who is known to always wear his Battlemaster suit. Gossip says he wears it due to a crippling accident on a floating chair. The master of Divination Mara Revus who is also the tower inspector, she also helps in the gladiatorial Matches to make sure the fights are fair and without the use of magic. Other pronounced individuals include Provost Tavi for the school of summoning, lady Omador the prefect for the tower district.

while the wizards of evocation and Transmutation schools go off on a One VS One battle. the artificers go through a more mundane and old school style of exam. We are tested on our knowledge of our magic and what it means to each of us individually. I tell them of how my people and our magic are  connected to the earth and world around us. It is like water a source of life. being a shepard of the Stars below in the miniri mountains, magic has been a source of our fertile land, perfect immune systems, and just down right happiness. The test i was most nervous for was the Religion portion. The Tower is run by Devout worshipers of  Istrius god of knowledge. Being from the mountains me and my people never really worship the god. so for about one whole day prior to this test, i study my ass off on Istrius. i may not be a full blown follower, but maybe in time after learning about him i may become religous myself. 

after being selected into the final exam, the articers are tasked with creating work based on a theme. My theme is "lighter than air" i have one weeks time during to create my piece. i have some excess to the workshops in the tower and must make it in time of the festivals and gladiator fights towards the end of the month.
