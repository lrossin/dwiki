# Important NPCs

# Rumours
The City Watch told Ganymede the gang is fairly new in Cyfaraun, only being present for the last 2 or three years.

# Interaction with Party
## Barnabas
The party initially gained favour with the gang by rescuing [Barnabas](/npcs/barnabas), although they did not know of his association.

## Getting mugged
While checking out shops near the Half-Full Tankard, Ganymede was mugged by 3 members after refusing to pay a "street tax" of 2gp. When woken up by the city guard, they mentioned a reward for finding the hideout, and to report it directly to Watch Captain Varrick as some of the guards are in cahoots with the gang. 

## Retaliation
Ganymede wanted revenge. Then next day, the party sets a trap at the Weary's Rest Wayside Inn/Tavern in the Merchant's District. Ganymede, appearing as an old woman, entered the tavern. Paying with gold to display wealth. The rest of us set up around the alley for the ambush: Praahi on the roof, Grug in the sewer, Kalland and Zulban in the back under tarps. One man followed Ganymede out of the bar, two more already in the alley join in to jump Ganymede. The party knocks out and captures two of them, the third escapes into the crowd. The party bound and took the gang members to the City Watch. Varrick wasn't there, instead they talked to Watchcaptain Landris (purple tiefling female). They were confused but give uthe party a seal for the main watch headquarters to claim a 250gp bounty. When turning in the bounty, Sgt. Luin warned that messing with the Sand & Bone was a bad idea.

## Walking into headquarters
Still unaware that Barnabus was a member of the gang, the party went to see him at the [Silk Pony]. [Thanna] explains that the Silk Pony is the Sand & Bone Headquarters. After the retaliation to the mugging a few days prior, the party is not welcome here. She offered the party an escape through the sewers as a thank you for saving Barnabas, but to expect to be hunted by the gang. Zulban said that she should apologize to them because her gang attacked a member of the party first. And that the party has the Mercenary's Guild on their side, so she should be afraid of them, not the other way around. The party left without further incident.
