# Rumors


> Watchcaptains Varrick and Landris informed us that some soldiers are in cahoots with Sand & Bone (link) and other organized crime. 

> Unwilling to apprehend Baltar Lazareo (link), cousin of Nicus Celdor Lazareo (link), for at least three counts of illegal dueling that have lead to the deaths of minor nobles.

# Interactions with the Party
Watch Captain Varrick and his soldiers responded to Ganymede's mugging and informed him of the Sand & Bone.

We delivered the captured members of Sand & Bone to Watch Captain Landris, in exchange, we received bounty notes.

The next day we collected the 250gp bounty from Sergeant Luin at the main guard outpost, not far from the Mercenary guild. There we learned that the guards would pay for information about Sand & Bone and we were warned again that they were a dangerous group.

Ganymede, impersonating a veteran, heard several rumors and made three friendly contacts in the week leading up to the festival.
1. Sergeant of the Lake District
2. Sergeant under the command of a Centurion who was made to release Baltor
3. And the third one...
