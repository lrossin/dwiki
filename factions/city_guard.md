# Description
The city guard is overseen by house Drakomir's eldest son, Tribune Narmirio Drakomir.

The force is composed of 335 soldiers in total. 
- 300 common guards
- 30 captains 
- 3 Centurions
- Chief Osvald Ulfricson
- Tribune Narmirio Drakomir

# Rumors
> Chief Osvald is rumored to be having an affair with the lady Lonia Celeppes, wife of Jonus Valerian Celeppes. 

> Watchcaptains Varrick and Landris informed us that some soldiers are in cahoots with Sand & Bone (link) and other organized crime. 

> Unwilling to apprehend Baltar Lazareo (link), cousin of Nicus Celdor Lazareo (link), for at least three counts of illegal dueling that have lead to the deaths of minor nobles.

# Interactions with the Party
Watch Captain Varrick and his soldiers responded to Ganymede's mugging and informed him of the Sand & Bone.

We delivered the captured members of Sand & Bone to Watch Captain Landris, in exchange, we received bounty notes.

The next day we collected the 250gp bounty from Sergeant Luin at the main guard outpost, not far from the Mercenary guild. There we learned that the guards would pay for information about Sand & Bone and we were warned again that they were a dangerous group.

Ganymede, impersonating a veteran, heard several rumors and made three friendly contacts.
1. Sergeant of the Lake District
2. Sergeant under the command of a Centurion who was made to release Baltor
3. And the third one...
