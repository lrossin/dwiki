## First Contact
### It is believed that alcolytes of Dirgion were seen by Ganymede, dragging corpses through the sewers below the Bridge District. 
After following these hooded figures, we came to a gathering place defended by wicked cultists. A necromancer, commanding an abomination made to look like a centaur, attempted to oust us but failed and was delivered to the city guard. 
At the center of this room rests a mysterious pit that leads deeper into the forgotten ruins of the ancient city. 
## The Pit
### After descending far below the afformentioned alter, we came across a network of halls that seem to be in frequent use. 

To the north we see an Elf sweeping the floor, paying us no mind. 

Following footprints to the east, we came across a sealed doorway and proceeded to break it down, discovering an altar of sinister design. Centered in the room were corpses seated on benches, in each corner sleep-inducing incense burned and threatened to diminish our fighting spirit. Inspecting the corpses, we discovered a wight hiding in plain sight that we quickly disposed of.

To the north we found a 20ft statue of an Elvish priest carved from onyx. We chipped away at the creation and awakened the undead creatures that lurked nearby. Dispatching them was a ~~miracle~~ piece of cake. 

As we attempted to rest, we were targerted by another fiend whom we were able to run off. Around this time we realized we were trapped, the doorway we broke through was repaired and protected through magical means. 

We opted to look for a different way out and broke down another false wall that lead to a narrow hallway. In this passage, we found a sarcophagus and carvings in an unknown language. Inside the crypt we found the head of a mace which is now carried by Zulban. Further down the hallway, we came across a chasm about 120ft deep. We scaled the wall to a landing adjacent to the entrance we made and Praahi burned the fungus-riddled corpses that would have impeded our path forward. 

## The curse
Following this pathway, we came to an ornate dome-shaped room with a skull in the center. All around the great hall were depictions of various gods, chief among them was Dirgion. 

The skull came to life and offered to answer our questions. Kalland, Praahi, and Ganymede accepted the offer and learned that: There is a way out, Dirgion and Iskara are not allied, and...

Later, the toll for an answer was revealed. The three of us who asked a quetion were given the mark of Dirgion and brought unwillingly into his cult. Consequently, whenever one of us is near death, subjects of Dirgion will come to collect our souls. However, the curse did reveal the exit and allowed us all to escape back to the surface. 

## Zulban's Crusade
### Aided by the Knights of the Winged Sun, Zulban took another whack at the derranged cultists in the deep. 

After descending down the pit, they encountered the elf, still diligently sweeping the wet floors. They recognized that this creature was haunted by necrotic energy and liberated him from the confines of un-death. 

They defeated several animated corpses and concluded that they were not brought to life intentionally by a necromancer, but rather they were corpses exposed for too long to the dark power that radiates in these halls. this served as a reminder as to why cremation is a popular custom. 

Zulban warned the party of the cursed room we had fallen victim to and they avoided making the same mistake.
