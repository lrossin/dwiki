# Description
The Mercenary Guild is a source of muscle for hire across the borderlands. It is currently headed by [Guildmaster Balcadar Brogitarius](/npcs/Balcadar_Brogitarius) and its guild hall is located in the southern old town district of Cyfaraun. The guild often provides guards for caravans, bounties for bandits, and guards/scrying points for the Tower of Knowledge.

# Interaction with Party
The party initially joined the guild as a way to find some quick work but has since moved onto sleeping at the guild hall to avoid [blood_and_sand](/factions/blood_and_sand) as much as possible. The party took three Tower of Knowledge scrying spikes to be placed at points of interest with bounties varying based on the value of their placement. Additionally, the party learned of bandits in the Viaspen Forrest with a large bounty.
[Grug](/player_characters/grug) has taken to sparring in the guild hall and has gained some notoriety for her two current wins.
