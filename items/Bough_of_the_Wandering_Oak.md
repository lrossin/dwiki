## History:

A branch of a Bur Oak that was inhabited by a dryad and given to [grug](/player_characters/grug). Grows stronger when allowed to grow to it's full size.

The attuned wielder of this maul may cast the cantrip Druidcraft at will

The attuned wielder of this club may cast Speak w/ Animals 3 times per day

If you plant the maul vertically in living soil the tree will begin to grow at a rate of 1 foot every hour for 24 hours reaching 168 feet if allowed to grow for the full 7 days. There must be enough soil to support the roots of the tree. The tree will remain until: attunement is broken with the bough, it is dealt 30 pts of damage, or the command word is spoken and the Fresh Bough of the Wandering Oak is taken from its branches at which point the tree will disappear after 1 hour. After 7 days the tree becomes permanent. On the seventh day the tree drops 400lbs of acorns, 4 silver acorns, and a new Wandering bough may be taken by the attuned party member. The upon claiming the bough the attuned benefits from the same knowledge as if he had cast Commune with nature.

A silver accorn is a token which can be used to cast the spell Summon Fey at 3rd level as an action and is consumed on use.
