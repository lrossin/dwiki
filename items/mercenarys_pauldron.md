This magic pauldron has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. You can use a bonus action while wearing the pauldron to expend 1 of its charges to divine its tactical insights, magically granting you advantage on the next weapon attack roll you make before the end of your next turn. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type, and you gain that same amount of temporary hit points, which last until the end of your next turn.
