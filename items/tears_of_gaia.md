As an action, you can crush this small, green gem underfoot to activate its magic. Plants within a 10ft radius of you immediately become healthy and full. 

If no plants are within range or you crush the gem against an inorganic material, fertile topsoil an inch deep spreads across the area. Grass immediately begins to grow from the new soil. Fruit and vegetable-bearing plants start to grow their produce and are able to be eaten after an hour time to grow.
