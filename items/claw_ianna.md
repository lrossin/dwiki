The Claw of Ianna counts as a magical sword for the purposes of bypassing resistances. 

It grants the attuned wielder the ability to cast the cantrip Thaumaturgy at will. The wielder may also cast protection from evil (target self), once cast the sword cannot be used to cast this spell again until the attuned wielder has offered 10 minutes of prayer to Ianna at the new dawn.

So this sword will awaken more powers depending on your actions
