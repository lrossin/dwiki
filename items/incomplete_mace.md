# Origins
The head of this mace was found by [the party](/player_characters) in the tomb where a wight resided in the Temple to [Dirgion] at the [bottom of the sewers] under [Cyfaraun]. After leaving the sewers, [Kalland](/player_characters/kalland) cast detect magic and determined the mace was magical. He then cast Identify and learned that the head is a piece of a more powerful item. It was then given to [Zulban](/player_characters/zulban) to use. 
# Consultation with Vir
Zulban brought the mace to the dwarven smith [Vir](/NPCs/vir) to see if he had any insight, as well as to get a haft made to return the weapon to some sort of usability. Vir attached a wooden haft, making the weapon a silvered +1 mace. 
Vir said that the weapon seemed similar to the weapons described by the Order of [Knights of the Winged Sun](/factions/knights_of_the_winged_sun), and that Zulban should bring it to them at their barracks in the [temple district](/locations/cyfaraun/temple_district). Vir said that these weapons usually had a metal haft with celestial inscriptions and a amethyst pommel. The party then gave the amethyst necklace that was found along side the head to Zulban.
# Meeting with the Knights of the Winged Sun
Zulban and Praahi spoke with the guards at the door of the temple. They arranged a meeting for later that day at the mercenary guild hall. 
[Sub Altern Levit] and [Sage Nickias] arrived for the meeting and witness Grug throw Mankind off Hell In A Cell. After some boiler makers, they inspected the mace. They said it could be restored, and offered to prepare a haft. The white oak haft would have to be inscribed in 3 temples of law. The gem for the pommel would have to be blessed, either by a lawful god, or by a creature such as a unicorn, great eagle, or roc. Zulban mentioned that the party was planning on traveling to a [fountain of Mityara] in the [Viaspen Forest], and the paladins posited that such a location may be sufficient. They asked that if the party was headed toward [Torres Tem], to look out for a missing paladin errant, [Tannis Dracomore], who left after a blade sister named [Ziadara].
