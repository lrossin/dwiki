While wearing this belt, you can use your reaction and pronounce its
command word to cause it to inflate and transform into a magical ring
buoy. While it is transformed in this way, you can't sink into water and
you are considered under the effect of the spell Feather Fall. If already
underwater, you rise toward the surface at a speed of 60ft. This effect
lasts until you speak the command word again.
