## History:

Silvery acorns dropped when the [Bough of the Wandering Oak](/items/Bough_of_the_Wandering_Oak) reaches maturity. Four were dropped the first time the Oak reached full size.

## Item Description:

Silver Acorns are gifted by the spirit of a wandering Oak. These pewter acorns are roughly the size of a mans thumb. They grow and drop from the first yield of a newly planted Wandering Oak. These acorns commemorate the bond between the oak and its planter and only function for the one who planted the tree. In future mast years the oak may yield additional Silver Acorns.

Throwing the acorn on the ground as an action [summons a fey](/http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:summon-fey) creature as per the spell at third level. The Fey uses the casters wisdom score for all relevant derived stats.
