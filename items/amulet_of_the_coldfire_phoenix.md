A blue metallic pendant in the shape of a phoenix clutching a shimmering blue orb hangs from this leather cord. While wearing the necklace, you emit a frigid aura that grants you and creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you resistance to cold damage.

In addition, when you are reduced to 0 hit points while wearing the necklace but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. When you do, you gain 25 temporary hit points. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, that creature takes 25 cold damage. after 1 minute this effect ends and the shimmering blue orb melts away. This feature can not be used again unless the amulet is bathed in freezing flame.
