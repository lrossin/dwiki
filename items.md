Pages here are intended for items that are not available through official sources. For those items, use sources such as [Roll20](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Items%20List#content) or [5e.tools](https://5e.tools/items.html).

Pages should also be created for specific instances of an item that may require additional information. Such as [The Hole](/items/the_hole).

Search for the item tag to display a list of [all items](https://wiki.lllllllllll.duckdns.org/t/item?sort=title).

# Style Guide
All item pages must include the item tag. Tags should also be used to indicate item type, magic tier, rarity, and attunement requirements. This information may also be put in the subtitle of a page for readability.
